# Ionic2 Deck Hearthstone

## How to use

1. Download the example [or clone the repo]

2. Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run ionic:serve
```

## Why does this repository exist?
In one of the companies where I worked, I did practical classes related to Ionic 2 and Typescript to my coworkers.
I wanted to do a fun class so I choose a card game called Hearthstone and the exercise was build a deck builder.
